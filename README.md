# jenkins-config-groovy-scripts

This repo is a collection of Groovy scripts for configuring
Jenkins, possibly with tools like Chef.

## Help us help you

If you've written some code to configure something in Jenkins, please fork,
branch, commit, and create a pull request! I banged my head against the wall
trying to get some things configured -- hopefully we can save some headaches!
